# Ask Me Anything

A repository to ask me [@narainsagar](https://twitter.com/narainsagar) anything.

**Note:** Anything doesn't mean anything. Only relevant to my topics & stuffs.

### Ask a question

I get a lot of questions by email. I think, this is the most meaningful way to make answers globally present!
Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/narainsagar/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/narainsagar/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### About Me

![@narainsagar](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/narainsagar?&s=128)

I'm [working at Recurship](http://narainsagar.com/whoami) since 2 years and have worked on many web development projects (mostly single page web applications) using Node.js, JavaScript, JQuery, Angular2, TypeScript, Webpack, Bootstrap, HTML(5), CSS(3), PHP, MEAN Stack, etc. During the period I've learned a lot of  new things i.e., about culture, improving your development workflow, software development life cycle, software versioning & control system, and really important shit like automated testing (TDD). If you have a question you're interested in reading me tap out a response for, this is just the joint for you.
